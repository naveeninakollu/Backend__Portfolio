# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

### 👤 Solo Project by Naveen Sai Teja Inakollu

This is a full-stack personal portfolio website built to showcase my work, skills, and projects using modern web technologies.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (JSX, functional components, custom props)
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot (REST APIs, server-side logic)
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL, JSON-like documents)

---

## 📌 Project Summary

This portfolio website is a dynamic, responsive, and interactive platform developed using a **component-based architecture** in React.js. The backend, built with **Spring Boot**, serves REST APIs and integrates with **MongoDB** to manage persistent data such as project details and contact form submissions.

Data operations between frontend and backend use the native `fetch` API, and the setup is compatible with libraries like Axios for future enhancements.
